In addition to getting the paper proofed by a professional proofreader, we prioritised our revisions in line with the AC's recommendations.  

In accordance with R3's suggestions, to allocate space for our revisions, we first eliminated the two large tables in the paper, and the small table on data sources (formerly Table 2). To make up for this removal, we added to the textual description of PS.2 a summary of high-level findings for the first table, and a discussion of the data sources in the Methodology section (presented in the second table).

We introduced, under Background, several previous systems from the greater CHI/UIST community pertaining to end-user data integration, end-user programming, and mash-ups.  We emphasised the connection between the "non-programming" e.g., direct-manipulation approahces and ours in the paper. We hope this will adequately address both Reviewer 2 and 3's concerns pertaining to connections to relevant work.

To improve the description of the methodology, we worked to clarify motivation for the study design, and details concerning the information that was given to participants during each task.  This was to address R2's concerns about the connection between the study and our goals of understanding the suitability of DP's interface mechanisms. In addition, we significantly tightened the Discussion section to eliminate redundancy and to focus on the connection between the measurements reported and the way that each related to the core hypotheses presented. 

We mentioned the potential for introducing assistive (automatic matching) algorithms as well as crowd-powered approaches to helping people solve tricky partial- integration problems.  Due to lack of space (and because of its tangential nature) we did not delve extensively into our current approach, but we are using interaction traces to identify places where multiple individuals looking at the same data set performed the same consolidation action, and using this as a 'demonstration' training set for providing suggestions to the user.

Finally, we have improved the figures, including expanding to full width Fig 1, and increasing the font sizes of Fig 1, 2, and 5 for readability.  

Please let us know if there are any further improvements or clarifications that need to be made.
