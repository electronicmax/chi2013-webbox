        abstract = {Most existing PIM tools either suffer from having data isolated by being siloed in an application or only interact with specific tools offered through specific services. The consequences are that what people can do with their own data becomes constrained by what services application developers afford. We propose a web-standards based architecture called WebBox to support easy maintenance and repurposing of one's own data for private, social or public publishing, collaboration and reuse. }
